# Progress Report 3

### 1. Reading

I finally feel comfortable with the reading in general. I've read and understood through chapter 7 of ThinkBayes, though I'm looking forward to tomorrow's lecture which will hopefully clarify some of the concepts introduced in that chapter. I also skimmed the "Bayesian Methods for Hackers" article, which looked very useful, but was very very long.

### 2. Exercises

I tried working through the train exercise at the end of one of the chapters: the one where there were multiple companies of different sizes, and a train from any company was equally likely to be seen. I came to the conclusion that the factor of smaller companies having a greater likelihood of seeing any one train and the factor of it being more likely to see a train from a larger company canceled out. So it was equally likely for a train to belong to any company. This kind of makes sense, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were completely wrong -- it just seems a little too simple.

### 3. Case study

I found last class's lecture on using Bayesian reasoning to modify behavior very interesting, as one of my learning goals was to integrated Bayesian reasoning into the way I see the world and approach problems. I haven't solidified this yet, but I'm interested in ways to use Bayesian reasoning to model peoples' behavior, or to modify my own. I'll try hard to turn this into the start of a real case study by the end of next week.

### 4. Reflection

I'm learning about more formal ways to represent probabilities (PDFs, CDFs). I found CDFs very interesting once I finally understood them. Distributions (poisson, binomial, etc.) are also pretty cool now that I understand what they represent. I like the mentions of modeling decisions, as that's something I'm familiar with from many of my other classes. I finally got my IPython notebook working, so I'm on track for my Python-related learning goal. And if my case study aligns with my general life-oriented learning goal, I'll be set.
