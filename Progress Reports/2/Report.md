# Progress Report 2

### 1. Reading

I read chapter 4 of ThinkBayes, and skimmed chapters 5 and 6. I intend to go back and read the readings in more detail this weekend, but catching up on Bayesian was supplanted this week by catching up on all my other classes after the hackathon. I also read your blog post about the Lincoln Index problem -- I was familiar with the premise and found the article interesting.

### 2. Exercises
I didn't have the chance to go through any exercises this week. This weekend I'll definitely play with suites and Pmfs more -- I'm also interested in playing with beta distributions because of their computational efficiency and simplicity.

### 3. Case study

Since I missed the first day of class, I didn't know the case study was actually on a topic of our choosing until tonight. I'll come up with a topic this weekend and start looking into it.

### 4. Reflection

I'm looking forward to putting more time into this class once my schedule normalizes (which should actually happen this week). Now that my environment is set up, I'm prepared to delve into the ThinkBayes code and run through some examples.
